# Georgia Morrison Data Science Portfolio
### Here is a collection of the projects I have worked on either as part of a course, or for personal interest. Projects have been completed in either Python, R or SQL.
### All of these projects include a section at the end relating to my main learnings from the project, and how I moved past difficulties I faced.

## Python Projects
[Sales Spreadsheet Analysis](https://github.com/georgia-morrison/sales_analysis_cfg)
* This project was completed as part of Code First Girls Python Kickstarter course and was a collaboration between me and another student
* The task was to read in a CSV file and output the total sales across the year
* We then had the option to extend our project which we did through a graph and table

## R Projects
[The Scottish Referendum](https://github.com/georgia-morrison/scottish-referendum)
* This project was completed as part of my Statistical Methods class at university
* It looks at finding patterns amongst voters

[Sulphur Dioxide over Europe](https://github.com/georgia-morrison/sulphur-dioxide-over-europe)
* Another project completed as part of my Statistical Methods class at university
* It looks at SO2 levels over different European measuring stations in the 1990's
